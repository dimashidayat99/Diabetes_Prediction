# About Dataset
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC. Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services. It has been conducted every year since 1984. For this project, a csv of the dataset available on Kaggle for the year 2015 was used.

# About Project
The aim of this project is to developed data driven diabetes prediciton system for people to get early screening for diabetes. Overall idea of this project is to use the health-realted survey data that is obtained from kaggle to be processed and analyzed for predictive analysis, where the machine learning will predict the diabetes class (a person is diabetic or non-diabetic) based on several features or factor from the data.

The diabetes prediction was my first data science project, therefore, project was developed by using various methodology will be used for data preprocessing. In the notebook of [modelling exploration](https://github.com/dimashidayat99/Diabetes_Prediction/blob/main/Diabetes%20prediction%20modelling%20exploration.ipynb), I explore all possible methods to process the data such as use multiple data scaling methods such as minmax scaler, robust scaler and standard scaler. The project uses multiple features selection method such as pearson correlation and random forest (feature selection by machine learning). The project also use multiple data balancing method such as smote upsampling and nearmiss downsampling. In the notebook also use several conventional or traditional machine learning model such as logistic regression, gaussian, k-nearest neighbour, extra tree, random forest, decision tree, light gbm and xgboost. All the models were evaluated by using several metrics to measure the performance including accuracy, precision positive, precision negative, recall sensitivity, recall specitivity, f1 positive and f1 negative. All the models and methodology was compared based on the evaluation metrics to find the best models and methods to analyzed the data.

The best methodology and model will be used to undergo the optimization process known as hyperparameter tuning to find the best parameter of the models. The best methodology and the model was used to develop the data driven diabetes prediction system.
